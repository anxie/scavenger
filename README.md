# 321 Quest

This project was developed for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program final project.

Combining the fun of Snapchat and geocaching, 321 Quest allows friends to challenge each other to scavenger hunts in the real world.

This app allows users to register for an account and add friends. Users can then create scavenger hunts and challenge friends to send pictures of quest items!
